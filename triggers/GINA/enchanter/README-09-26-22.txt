*** Updated 09/26/22


*** Notes:

--- Redid or added regex checks on all triggers
--- Compartamentlized the triggers better to make it easier to turn off what you don't want on
--- Removed Caster aDPS sub-folder
--- Added a common trigger sub-folder for Improved Twincast and Shield (spell guard)


*** Information:

1. These triggers will be placed in a top level folder called: Rexa's GINA Triggers

2. Subfolders are: "Common Triggers" and "Enchanter"


*** Categories:

- Every trigger has an assigned category based on my own personal overlays for GINA. 

- As a result, any triggers with timers may auto-populate in your default overlay.

- You are responsible for changing the categories or assigning them correctly to your own GINA overlays.


*** Any Problems?

--- Email me directly at: contact@rexaraven.com
--- Or, DM me via Discord at: Rexa#4320
--- Before you contact me with any issues...
--- Lag (especially raid lag) can sometimes affect timers being slightly off in many cases
